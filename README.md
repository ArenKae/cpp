## An introduction to C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". This repository is a collection of modules that make up 42 school's C++ piscine. The modules gradually introduce students to concepts related to object-oriented programming, such as classes, inheritance, ad-hoc polymorphism, templates, containers, and more.
